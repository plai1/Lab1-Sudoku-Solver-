ASSIGNMENT: Lab1 (Sodoku Solver)

BIG O NOTATION & SPACE COMPLEXITY: The Big-O-Notation of the sudoku algorithm is O(n^m) where "n" is the number of 											   possibilities for eacch square and "m" is the number of spaces that are blank.
								   Based from the number of temporary variables used in the aglorithem (3 variables) I can probably conclude that the Space Complexity is O(n^2)

IMPLEMENATION INSTRUCTIONS: 1. Run Code in Terminal

							2. When inputing numbers, don't use spaces or commas to seperate the numbers, make sure there are exactly nine   	digits.

							3. After inputing nine digits numbers nine times, Sudoku solver algorithm will execute and determines if the 	   sudoku was solveable or not.

							4. If the puzzle is solvable, the code will present the finished grid,
							   If the puzzle is not solveable, the code will present the untouched grid
